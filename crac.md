### Showcase SpringBoot 3.2 automatic checkpoint at start on Linux

#### Setup the environment
1. Download a JDK with support for CRaC e.g.
- [Azul Zulu 21.0.1 + CRaC X64](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu21.30.19-ca-crac-jdk21.0.1-linux_x64.tar.gz)
- [Azul Zulu 21.0.1 + CRaC AARCH64](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu21.30.19-ca-crac-jdk21.0.1-linux_aarch64.tar.gz)

2. Unpack the tar.gz file and copy the JDK in a folder
- ```sudo tar zxvf zulu21.30.19-ca-crac-jdk21.0.1-linux_x64.tar.gz```
- ```mv zulu21.30.19-ca-crac-jdk21.0.1-linux_x64 zulu-21.jdk```
- ```sudo mv zulu-21.jdk /usr/lib/jvm```

3. Set the $JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK with CRaC support e.g.
- ```export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/zulu-21.jdk```

4. Make sure you have the permissions to run CRIU
- ```sudo chown root:root $JAVA_HOME/lib/criu```
- ```sudo chmod u+s $JAVA_HOME/lib/criu```

5. Make sure you have the dependency to org.crac added to your build file
- gradle: <br>
```implementation 'org.crac:crac:1.4.0'```
- maven :
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.crac</groupId>
  <artifactId>crac</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>  
```

<br><br>

#### Build the application
1. Open the project folder
2. run ```gradlew clean build```
3. Now you should find the the jar at ```build/libs/spring-petclinic-3.2.0.jar```
4. Create a folder named ```tmp_auto_checkpoint``` in the project folder (besides the ```src``` folder)
5. Create a folder named ```tmp_manual_checkpoint``` in the project folder (besides the ```src``` folder)

<br><br>

#### Start the application without any CRaC
1. Start the application normally
```bash start.sh```

<br>

#### Info:
A checkpoint can also be compressed (only in Azul Zulu) on the hard drive by executing
```export CRAC_CRIU_OPTS=--compress```
It is already in the two shell scripts for starting up the app with the different options
- start-auto-crac.sh
- start-manual-crac.sh
So you simply have to un-comment it in these shell scripts.
Be aware that the compression at checkpoint and decompression at restoring will take longer.
Meaning to say the restore will be slower when using a compressed checkpoint (on my machine used here it takes around 150ms to de-compress the checkpoint)

<br>

#### Start the application and automatically create a checkpoint after the framework startup
1. Make sure the folder ```tmp_auto_checkpoint``` exists
2. Remove all files from the folder ```tmp_auto_checkpoint``` with ```rm ./tmp_auto_checkpoint/*.*```
3. Start the application and automatically create a checkpoint
```bash start-auto-crac.sh```

<br>

#### Restore the application from the automatically created checkpoint
1. Restore the application from the stored checkpoint
```bash restore-auto-crac.sh```

<br><br>

#### Start the application and create a checkpoint manually after application startup
1. Make sure the folder ```tmp_manual_checkpoint``` exists
2. Remove all files from the folder ```tmp_manual_checkpoint```with ```rm ./tmp_manual_checkpoint/*.*```
3. Start the application 
```bash start-manual-crac.sh```

### Create the manual checkpoint
There are two ways of creating the checkpoint manually, calling the application jar or the pid

1. Calling the application jar
```jcmd spring-petclinic-3.2.0.jar JDK.checkpoint```

or 

1. Executing the ```create-manual-checkpoint.sh``` script with the PID (can be found in the output in the 1st shell window)
```bash create-manual-checkpoint.sh PID```

2. Check if the checkpoint files have been stored in ```./tmp_manual_checkpoint```

<br>

#### Restore the application from the manually created checkpoint
1. Restore the application from the stored checkpoint by executing
```bash restore-manual-crac.sh```
